## Objective 

• The primitive aim of the project is to detect and identify any sort of disease that originates in plants, without any kind of human interaction with the crops in the agricultural field. 
• Secondly, the data is to be sent to a local server for further processing by a software. 
• Thirdly, if there is any kind of discrepancy in the data, alert notification will be sent to the owner of the agricultural field.

## Introduction

### Problem Statement 
Now-a-days, due to the increased number of diseases in the agricultural fields across the crops, the production of the desired product is decreasing at a significant rate. This is to be tackled in a professional manner with correct use of efficient and economically stable technology. This can maneuver the agricultural production in a positive manner.

### Existing Technologies 
• There are few technologies which use visual inspection of plant germplasm and subsequent selection of healthy material. There are technologies such as serodiagnostics, cytometry, real-time PCR. 
• The technology i.e. the bot that we will be using will not require any human interaction with the crops in the field.
